# About
Themr allows you to quickly select your UI theme from the command palette, as well as providing key bindings to easily cycle forward and backward through your themes.

# Installation
Install Themr through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) or download and extract Themr into your Packages folder.

# Usage
Select "Themr: List themes" from the command palette to bring up the available themes. Default binding: `ctrl+shift+f5` (Windows/Linux) `super+shift+f5` (OSX)

The "Themr: Next theme" `ctrl+shift+f7` (Windows/Linux) `super+shift+f7` (OSX) command will skip to the next available theme.

The "Themr: Previous theme" `ctrl+shift+f8` (Windows/Linux) `super+shift+f8` (OSX)command will skip to the previous available theme.

# Sublime Text 3 compatibility
ST3 support is limited to `.sublime-theme` files located in your `/Packages/` directory. Themes saved as `.sublime-package` files (such as through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)) in the `/Installed Packages/` directory are not yet supported.

Temporary workaround: unzip the `.sublime-package` file to a folder in the `/Packages/` directory.
